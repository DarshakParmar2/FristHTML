        [1/6, 6:54 PM] Darshak Parmar: The perfect plan?
    It was here all along
    Whether you are uploading content to the cloud, sharing photos with family, building a business, or managing a team, Dropbox has a  plan to keep your life moving forward.
    n [1/6, 6:55 PM] Darshak Parmar: Dropbox Plus: More of the good stuff
    Deleting old photos and videos to make room for new ones isn't the solution. Instead, get the space you need to keep all of your files stored securely in one organized place that you can access anytime, anywhere
    [1/6, 6:55 PM] Darshak Parmar: Dropbox Family: Together we can do more

    <blockquote> Tired of being the familys tech support? Skip the back and forth and come together with 2,000 GB (that s about 500,000 photos) of shared cloud storage. While everyone gets their own account for photos, passwords, and docs, the Family Room is where you can share anything from pictures and recipes to medical records and copies of your new lease.</blockquote>
